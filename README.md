The goal for this project is to create a hangman game with a bit of my own twist.
I would like the game to automatically generate a random word on restart every time.
Instead of the typical hangman character on a stand, id like to make it an a man falling from an airplane.

# Instrustions:
===============
        This is a game of word knowledge and chance. To play this game, you must correctly guess all of the letters in the word. If you fail, the character will fall from the plane...we dont want that. If you wish to give up, you can reset the game using the button on the bottom.
        Good luck and have fun!

# API info:

                Used to pull random words into the game without the need for a word library.
